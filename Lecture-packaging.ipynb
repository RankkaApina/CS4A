    "### Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of modules in the same directory is called a package.\n",
    "For the package to be visible from Python, the directory must contain a file called `__init__.py`. The main purpose of this file is to signal to Python that the directory\n",
    "is a package and that all the other files in the directory ending in `.py` are importable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `__init__.py` does not need to have any code in it. If it does, it is going to be executed before any other module in the package is imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package takes the name of the directory and may have subdirectories called `sub-packages`.\n",
    "A package can have a structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "packagename/\n",
    "|---__init__.py\n",
    "|---__main__.py\n",
    "|---othermodule.py\n",
    "|---more\n",
    "|   |--__init.py__\n",
    "|   |--moremodule.py\n",
    "|   |--evenmoremodule.py\n",
    "|---raw\n",
    "|   |--data.txt\n",
    "|   |--otherdata.txt\n",
    "|   |--orphan.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case the package `packagename` has three modules (`__init__.py`,`__main__.py`,\n",
    "`othermodule.py`) and one subpackage `more`. The `raw` directory does not count as subpackage because it does not contain the module `__init__.py`. This is true even if it\n",
    "contains the Python file `orphan.py` which is unreachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside a package you can import modules at the same level without giving the package name.\n",
    "This is called `implicit relative importing`:\n",
